   The following description is approximate and current as of the Ampere family.
   It may change for future generations and is intended to assist in understanding
   the driver code.

Introduction
============

PRAMIN is a hardware aperture mechanism that provides CPU access to GPU Video RAM (VRAM) before
the GPU's Memory Management Unit (MMU) and page tables are initialized. This 1MB sliding window,
located at a fixed offset within BAR0, is essential for setting up page tables and other critical
GPU data structures without relying on the GPU's MMU.

Architecture Overview
=====================

The PRAMIN aperture mechanism is logically implemented by the GPU's PBUS (PCIe Bus Controller Unit)
and provides a CPU-accessible window into VRAM through the PCIe interface::

PBUS (PCIe Bus Controller) is responsible for, among other things, handling MMIO
accesses to the BAR registers.

PRAMIN Window Operation
=======================

The PRAMIN window provides a 1MB sliding aperture that can be repositioned over
the entire VRAM address space using the ``NV_PBUS_BAR0_WINDOW`` register.

Window Control Mechanism
-------------------------

::

    NV_PBUS_BAR0_WINDOW Register (0x1700):
    +-------+--------+--------------------------------------+
    | 31:26 | 25:24  |               23:0                   |
    | RSVD  | TARGET |            BASE_ADDR                 |
    |       |        |        (bits 39:16 of VRAM address)  |
    +-------+--------+--------------------------------------+

    The 24-bit BASE_ADDR field encodes bits [39:16] of the target VRAM address,
    providing 40-bit (1TB) address space coverage with 64KB alignment.

    TARGET field (bits 25:24):
    - 0x0: VRAM (Video Memory)
    - 0x1: SYS_MEM_COH (Coherent System Memory)
    - 0x2: SYS_MEM_NONCOH (Non-coherent System Memory)
    - 0x3: Reserved

.. note::
   Nova only uses TARGET=VRAM (0x0) for video memory access. The SYS_MEM
   target values are documented here for hardware completeness but are
   not used by the driver.

64KB Alignment Requirement
---------------------------

The PRAMIN window must be aligned to 64KB boundaries in VRAM. This is enforced
by the ``BASE_ADDR`` field representing bits [39:16] of the target address::

    VRAM Address Calculation:
    actual_vram_addr = (BASE_ADDR << 16) + pramin_offset
    Where:
    - BASE_ADDR: 24-bit value from NV_PBUS_BAR0_WINDOW[23:0]
    - pramin_offset: 20-bit offset within the PRAMIN window [0x00000-0xFFFFF]

    Example Window Positioning:
